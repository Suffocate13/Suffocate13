# 👋 Hi, I’m Anonga Mabuda  

💻 I’m a **Business Information Technology student** diving deep into **front-end development, research, and business analytics** — with a growing love for **technical writing** and **R programming**.  

🌍 What really drives me is exploring the **intersection of tech with sustainable practices** — from healthcare systems to agriculture and beyond. I believe code shouldn’t just *work*; it should *matter*.  

⚡ **A few things about me**:  
- I build responsive **web & mobile apps**  
- I dabble in **databases & data analysis**  
- I care about **designing solutions that are functional, human-centered, and sustainable**  
- Occasionally, I write docs that people *actually* want to read (yes, it’s possible 👀)  

🚀 **Projects I’ve worked on**:  
- **Mpilo System** – Electronic health record platform improving patient access in 3 African countries  
- **SkillUpZA** – Web app connecting job seekers with employers  
- **MetaWaySA** – NFT marketplace giving South African artists digital exposure
